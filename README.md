# discord.js-embed-maker
Simple way of creating embeds in a Discord server, simply use -embed <text> to create one (supports formatting). Use -setprefix <prefix> to change the prefix and -setfooter <text> to change the footer of the embed (this will be saved in config.json)
## installation
Simply drop the files into a folder and run `node index.js`. Optionally you can also edit the config.json file.
This bot should be compatable with most Discord.js hosts.
